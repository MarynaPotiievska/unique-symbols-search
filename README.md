“The Tortoise and the Hare” by Aesop
This classic fable (story) is about a very slow tortoise (turtle) and a speedy hare (rabbit). The tortoise challenges the hare to a race. The hare laughs at the idea that a tortoise could run faster than him, but the race ends with a surprising result. Have you ever heard the English expression, “Slow and steady wins the race”? This story is the basis for that common phrase. You can read it for free, along with a number of other stories in this list!

you'll receive symbol "e".
